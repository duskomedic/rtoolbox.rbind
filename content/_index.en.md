> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see... 
Let us take boring flat data and bring it to life through visualization."

> **Open data** is data in digital format that is made available to everyone. To access it without the need for negotiation or obstruction at any time is a fundamental feature of the democratisation of digital data. In order for this to happen it requires public authorities to make data available to everyone, in particular those with the necessary skills and knowledge to reveal and interpret the story within complex details. A greater understanding of data empowers citizens to make more informed decisions in processes that directly affect their lives.

> **R** together with **RStudio** is the best data science tool! It is open source and free software that is available to anyone with a desire to discover, learn, explore, experience, expand and share the algorithms of their data science journey.
